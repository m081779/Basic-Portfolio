				<hr>

				<p class="about-text"><img id="main-img" src="http://www.fillmurray.com/200/200" alt="Picture of Marco Principio">Hello, whomever you are, and welcome to my little slice of the world wide web.  Feel free to poke around, just make yourself at home!  If you would like to see some of my work, please check out my portfolio.</p>

				<br>	

				<p class="about-text">But enough of the formalities, let's get to the meat and potatoes of the matter.  Who am I?  Well, I'm a guy who likes to make...things.  Things of all sorts, but mostly of the pixel-based variety.</p>

				<p class="about-text">My interest in writing code started with dabbling in writing scripts for microcontrollers, and eventually led to the wonderful world of Web design and development.  Which brings us to today.</p>

				<p class="about-text">I am currently a student in the UNC-Chapel Hill coding bootcamp studying to become a full stack web developer.  My primary interests are in UI/UX right now, but who knows where this crazy rollercoaster will take me?  </p>

				<p class="about-text">Bookmark this page if you would like to keep tabs on my progress, and if you would like to work with me, then hit me up on my contact form.  Thanks, and have an awesome day!</p>
